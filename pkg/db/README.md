# Tables on KV

## Fundamental Concept
Data is modelled as 2D tables consisting of rows and columns, which can be conceptually mapped onto a simpler Key-Value store. 

**Query Types:**
1. **Point Query**: Retrieve a single row by its exact primary key
2. **Range Query**: Iterate through multiple rows in sorted primary key order
